== 0.2 (2011-10-01) ==
features:
* new Special:HeadersFooters page for easy header/footer creation/editing
* compatibility with MW messages, better i18n support (thanks Alphos, bawolff)

breaking changes / requires admin action:
* switch to MW messages changes all header/footer urls, you will need to move them! Sorry!
  The new method is much more robust, the old method can potentially break other
  pages/messages in your wiki. i18n support is also improved as messages are unlikely
  to break between MW translation changes of namespaces.
* $wgHeadersFootersUsingPages's new default is false for speed reasons, 
  if you use or want page headers/footers please set it to true in your LocalSettings.php 

notes:
* switched hook ParserBeforeStrip to ArticleAfterFetchContent for better support and less hacks (thanks Dantman)
* cleaned up functions and simplified the extension, making use of more core messaging functions, Xml object
* special thanks to RoanKattouw, DanielFriesen and Dantman for coding advice

testing:
* svn: trunk 2011-10-01, 1.18alpha 2011-10-01, 1.17branch 2011-10-01
* releases: 1.17.0, 1.16.0, 1.15.5

issues:
* after defining a header/footer you may need to do a &action=purge on affected pages
